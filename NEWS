1.80-2: 2011/04/12

	Incorporate changes from LIBLINEAR versions 1.51 to 1.80:
		- Use set_print_string_function to set the print function
		- Add free_model_content and free_and_destroy_model functions (avoid memory problem if users declare a model variable)
		- Add check_probability_model (consistent with libsvm)
		- A new solver: coordinate descent for dual logistic regression
		- New optimization method for l1-regularized logistic regression
		- linear.cpp: 
			* Use 1-norm stopping condition for l1-regularized solvers 
			* newton_iter < l/10 replaced by newton_iter <= l/10 in l2r_lr_dual (for l < 10)
		
	predict.LiblineaR function can return additional information:
		- probabilities (only for logistic regression models)
		- decision values
