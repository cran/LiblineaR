Description: A wrapper around the LIBLINEAR C/C++ library for machine
        learning (available at
        <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/>). LIBLINEAR is
        a simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear
        classification and regression. It currently supports
        L2-regularized classification (such as logistic regression,
        L2-loss linear SVM and L1-loss linear SVM) as well as
        L1-regularized classification (such as L2-loss linear SVM and
        logistic regression) and L2-regularized support vector
        regression (with L1- or L2-loss). The main features of
        LiblineaR include multi-class classification (one-vs-the rest,
        and Crammer & Singer method), cross validation for model
        selection, probability estimates (logistic regression only) or
        weights for unbalanced data. The estimation of the models is
        particularly fast as compared to other libraries.
