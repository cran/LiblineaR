\title{Predictions with LiblineaR model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{LiblineaR}(object, newx, proba = FALSE,
  decisionValues = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{"LiblineaR"}, created by
\code{LiblineaR}.}

\item{newx}{An n x p matrix containing the new input data. A vector will be
transformed to a n x 1 matrix. A sparse matrix (from SparseM package) will
also work.}

\item{proba}{Logical indicating whether class probabilities should be
computed and returned. Only possible if the model was fitted with
\code{type}=0, \code{type}=6 or \code{type}=7, i.e. a Logistic Regression.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{decisionValues}{Logical indicating whether model decision values should
be computed and returned. Only possible for classification models
(\code{type}<10). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Currently not used}
}
\value{
By default, the returned value is a list with a single entry:
\item{predictions}{A vector of predicted labels (or values for regression).}
If \code{proba} is set to \code{TRUE}, and the model is a logistic
regression, an additional entry is returned:
\item{probabilities}{An n x k matrix (k number of classes) of the class
  probabilities. The columns of this matrix are named after class labels.}
If \code{decisionValues} is set to \code{TRUE}, and the model is not a
regression model, an additional entry is returned:
\item{decisionValues}{An n x k matrix (k number of classes) of the model
  decision values. The columns of this matrix are named after class labels.}
}
\description{
The function applies a model (classification or regression) produced by the \code{LiblineaR} function to every row of a
data matrix and returns the model predictions.
}
\note{
If the data on which the model has been fitted have been centered
  and/or scaled, it is very important to apply the same process on the
  \code{newx} data as well, with the scale and center values of the training
  data.
